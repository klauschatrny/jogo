# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status: pre-implementation

There is **no source code yet**. The repository currently contains only planning artifacts. The
canonical spec is **`TDV_Arquitetura.md`** — a full GDD + software architecture for *A Torre da
Vingança* (Tower of Vengeance), a 2D retro roguelike. Read it before writing any code; each section
is self-contained and meant to be pasted as prompt context when implementing the corresponding phase.

Note: `README.md` and `.gitignore` are leftover Node/Next.js template files and **contradict** the
actual decision in the GDD. The chosen stack is **Godot 4 + GDScript** (§0.1). Treat the GDD as the
source of truth, not the README. When scaffolding, replace these template files accordingly.

## Architecture (planned — from `TDV_Arquitetura.md`)

The defining structural decision is a **rigid Core ↔ Presentation split**. Internalize the dependency
rule before adding files (§2.3):

```
presentation  ──may import──►  core, services, data_layer
states        ──may import──►  core, services, data_layer
core          ──may import──►  (only core + pure services)
core          ──NEVER imports──►  presentation / render / engine APIs
```

`src/core/` holds all game logic (combat, progression, RNG, ghost/nemesis rules) and must remain
render-free and unit-testable without opening a window. Violating this rule is the single most
important thing to avoid — it makes the logic non-portable and untestable.

Four non-negotiable principles (§0.2):
1. **Data-driven** — weapons, enemies, augments, floors, and *all* tuning constants live in JSON
   under `data/` (see `data/balance.json`, Appendix A). Never hardcode game numbers in logic.
2. **Pure core** — see the dependency rule above.
3. **Deterministic RNG** — every random draw goes through a seeded `RNGService`. Same seed → same
   run. Do not call engine/global RNG directly anywhere in core.
4. **Events over coupling** — systems communicate via a global `EventBus` (signals). UI listens to
   core; core never references UI.

### Key systems to understand before editing across files

- **Stack-based FSM** (§2.1): a central `StateMachine` does `push`/`pop`/`change`; each `GameState`
  has `enter/exit/update/handle_input`. `Pause` is pushed *over* `Combat` without destroying it. The
  transition table in §2.1 is the implementation source of truth.
- **Scaling asymmetry** (§1.2): enemies grow geometrically per floor; the player grows linearly and
  only catches up through weapon upgrades + augments. The master formulas (HIT_DAMAGE / DPS / EHP)
  belong in `CombatResolver` so balancing stays centralized. Tune via `balance.json`, never in code.
- **Augment stacking order** (§1.3.2): `final = ((base + ΣADD) * (1 + ΣPCT_ADD)) * ΠMULT`. Implement
  in `StatResolver`; `MULT` is reserved for Artifact-tier effects.
- **Nemesis / Ghost system** (§1.4): the signature mechanic. `GhostData` is the only entity that
  persists across permadeath (`user://saves/ghosts.json`). `GhostFactory` builds a nerfed ELITE-rank
  enemy from a prior run's snapshot, enforcing the 5 math rules (nemesis coeff, HP cap relative to
  current player, partial augment inheritance, simplified "echo" AI, single summon at boss HP
  threshold). The anti-impossible HP cap rule must have tests.

## Planned folder structure

See §2.3 for the authoritative tree. Top level: `data/` (JSON content + `balance.json`),
`src/{core,data_layer,states,presentation,services,autoload}/`, `assets/`, `tests/`, `docs/`.

## Implementation roadmap

Build in the 5-phase order from §2.4 — each phase is a playable/testable milestone and depends on the
previous one. Do not skip ahead:
1. **Foundation** — folder skeleton, `BalanceConfig`, `EventBus`, seeded `RNGService`, FSM + MainMenu,
   JSON loaders.
2. **Combat & movement** — `Player`/`Weapon`/`StatBlock`, `CombatResolver`, one melee weapon, one
   `NORMAL` enemy, basic HUD.
3. **Progression / augments / normal bosses** — leveling + scaling, `WaveSpawner`/`FloorManager`,
   `Augment` + `StatResolver`, weighted `AugmentPool`, card-select UI, phased boss.
4. **Full tower & nemesis** — 50-floor loop, 5 great bosses, `GhostData`/`GhostRepository`,
   `GhostFactory`/`NemesisRules`, ghost summon + catharsis buff, King arena, death/victory screens.
5. **Balance, juice, polish** — `sim_balance` TTK simulator, game feel, audio, retro aesthetic,
   hardcore graveyard variant, accessibility, save edge cases.

## Commands

No build/test tooling exists yet (no `project.godot`, no test runner configured). Once the Godot 4
project is scaffolded:
- Tests are GDScript files under `tests/` (e.g. `test_combat_resolver.gd`) and run headless without a
  window — wire up a runner (e.g. GUT or `godot --headless`) during Phase 1 and document the exact
  command here.
- `tests/sim_balance.gd` (Phase 5) is a balance simulator, not a unit test: it computes TTK per floor
  for a "median" player and flags values outside the target bands in §1.2.4. Re-run it after changing
  any constant in `balance.json`.
